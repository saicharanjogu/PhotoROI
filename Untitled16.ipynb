        "\n",
        "**The Concept:** The goal is to find a single number that represents how \"open\" an eye is. The **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** achieves this by comparing the height of the eye to its width. When an eye closes, its height collapses to almost zero while its width stays nearly the same, causing the ratio to drop sharply.\n",
        "\n",
        "-----\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Calculation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The function uses 6 specific facial landmark points that outline the eye, as shown below:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Distance Measurement:** The code uses the `hypot` function, which calculates the standard **Euclidean distance** between two points $(x\\_1, y\\_1)$ and $(x\\_2, y\\_2)$. This is based on the Pythagorean theorem:\n",
        "    $Distance = \\\\sqrt{(x\\_2 - x\\_1)^2 + (y\\_2 - y\\_1)^2}$\n",

        "      * `horizontal_dist` measures the horizontal distance between the corners of the eye (the \"width\").\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **The Formula:** The final ratio is calculated with the formula:\n",
        "    $$EAR = \\frac{||p_2 - p_6|| + ||p_3 - p_5||}{2 \\cdot ||p_1 - p_4||}$$\n",

        "\n",
        "2.  **Normalization:** A simple mouth width measurement isn't enough, as a person with a larger face will naturally have a wider mouth. To solve this, we **normalize** the measurement by dividing it by a stable facial feature that relates to face size. The code uses the distance between two points on the jawline (landmarks 2 and 14) for this.\n",
        "    $Jaw Width = ||p\\_{2} - p\\_{14}||$\n",

        "\n",
